# Snake War
A 1-4 player competitive Snake-like game.
## [Preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz9lKAMsX_8)

This game follows the basic rules of Snake, but the game features a larger map and accelerated growth. Try to trap your opponents to make them run into themselves or you. Play alone, or with up to three others in a last-man-standing game.

This game currently requires gamepads to play. These can be anthing from PS4 or XBox to third party controllers.

I probably won't develop this any further as the code looks great and the game plays flawlessly. I may add sound or a countdown to the beginning of the game, but probably not.

# Compilation
The Makefile should cover compilation. Just make sure you have SDL installed on your computer
